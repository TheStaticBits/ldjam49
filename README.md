# Jam Fall 
(no, not the game jam kind of jam)

You're a conscious jar of jam. Shelves are disappearing around you (and reappearing, although you don't know why), and the floor has turned to lava... Try to stay alive for as long as possible as you witness the deaths of the other lifeless jars of jam!

The other jars on the shelves are purely for decoration, and to taunt you if you're below one :P.

### Controls
Use the arrow keys or WASD to control your jar of jam.

### Menu Options
Press "PLAY" at the top to play.
Change the difficulty between 6 difficulties!
View your previous score and the high score of the difficulty currently selected below that.

### Scoring
Every second is worth 10 points. The highest scores of each difficulty are automatically saved to highscores.txt.

### Things Used
- Programming language: Python with Pygame
- IDE: VSCode
- Sound effects: SFXR

## Difficulty Levels
- 1: Nobody Mode - You can literally afk between two platforms and get like 8 minutes
- 2: Beginner Mode - The difficulty is ramping up! But not by much currently
- 3: Intermediate Mode - This is the default difficulty, it provides a normal level of difficulty
- 4: Hard Mode - Slightly harder than Intermediate Mode
- 5: Harder Mode - This is where the difficulty really goes up! This one is challenging to get a score of 1000 on. You'll have to learn how to jump over gaps in the platforms!
- 6: Impossible Mode - Uhhh, this one is just, well, read the name

# BUG FIXES MADE AFTER RELEASE
- High scores (Best) not properly calculating. If you got a score that was lower than the actual best score, it would still overwrite your previous high score.

# TO PLAY
- Click on the current release on the right
- Click on the .zip file
- Extract the files from the .zip file
- Run JamFall.exe
- Enjoy! (Hopefully)
